# 3D printed peristaltic pump

I made a very simple peristaltic pump, to be printed as fast as possible and with a few parts to do some tests with glycerine. It is attachable to a NEMA 17 stepper motors as it is part of a larger project where it must control dispensed volume.

[Here](https://grabcad.com/library/3d-printed-peristaltic-pump-2) are the CAD files.
[Here](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/ppstep/) are the instructions.

## Tests

I did some calibrations to get a good relation ml/steps, the actual precision is enough for its purpose. The current firmware is in the src folder. There is also a video in the vid folder, where the pump is set to dispense 10 ml.
